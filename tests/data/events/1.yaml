  Rust is primarily a system-language, but there are plenty of web framework for Rust.
  At this event we are going to show how to get started using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework.

  This event will be in Zoom.

  Let me try to add the starting time in several time-zones manually. In pleaces where the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) site is the most popular.

  | location        | date   |
  | --------------- | ------ |
  | USA West coast  |  9:00 am |
  | USA East coast  |  12:00 am |
  | UK              |  17:00 |
  | CET             |  18:00 |
  | Israel, Ukraine |  19:00 |
  | India           |  22:30 |

  The speaker is [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) who is trying to make Meet-OS web site work well.


  As you can see you are on the meet-os web site and it looks like someone has just started to develop it. You are right.
  I've started to write it at the beginning of 2024 (that's 2 days ago) while trying to learn how to use Rocket.


  Hopefully by the time I am going to give this presentation the site will work much better.
