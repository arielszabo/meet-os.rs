  Rust is primarily a system-language, but there are plenty of web framework for Rust.
  At this event we are going to show how to get started using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework.


  This event will be in Zoom.


  The speaker is [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) who is trying to make Meet-OS web site work well.


  As you can see you are on the meet-os web site and it looks like someone has just started to develop it. You are right.
  I've started to write it at the beginning of 2024 (that's 2 days ago) while trying to learn how to use Rocket.


  Hopefully by the time I am going to give this presentation the site will work much better.


  ## Registration

  Soon, hopefully within days I'll add the registration system to this web site and then you'll be able to register
  and get notification of the event. For now, mark it in your calendar.

  Check the timezone! The time is given in UTC.
